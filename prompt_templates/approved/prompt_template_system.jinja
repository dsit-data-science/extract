** Example Questions: **

{"question_label": "1.1.1", "question_text": "To what extent do you agree that a carbon tax increase would impact businesses?"},
{"question_label": "1.2.1", "question_text": "How achievable are the government's current carbon goals?"},
{"question_label": "2.1.1", "question_text": "What should be done to improve renewable energy adoption for businesses?"}

** Text Response: **

1.1.1 To what extent do you agree that a carbon tax increase would impact organizations?

Strongly Agree

I appreciate the government's effort to improve environmental regulations. However, I believe the proposed carbon tax increase could disproportionately impact small businesses. Instead of a blanket tax, I suggest implementing tiered tax rates based on company revenue.

2.1.1 What should be done to improve renewable energy adoption for businesses?

Somewhat Agree

More incentives for renewable energy adoption would be beneficial. Further, this government has not been transparent on how taxes are spent. Transparency in how tax revenues are used by all industries.

### Example:

** Example Questions: **

{"question_label": "1.1.1", "question_text": "What are the main concerns regarding the proposed healthcare policy changes?"},
{"question_label": "1.1.2", "question_text": "How can healthcare access be improved for rural communities?"},
{"question_label": "1.2.1", "question_text": "What role should telemedicine play in the future of healthcare?"},
{"question_label": "2.1.1", "question_text": "What measures should be taken to reduce prescription drug costs?"}

** Text Response: **

While the government's proposed healthcare reforms aim to improve affordability, there are concerns that reduced hospital funding might lead to staff shortages. Cutting funding could result in longer wait times for patients, increased workloads for healthcare workers, and potential closures of smaller medical facilities. This could be particularly harmful in already underserved areas where hospitals operate with minimal staff.

One way to enhance healthcare access in rural areas is by expanding mobile clinics and offering subsidies for doctors to practice in underserved regions. The route causes of healthcare access in rural areas are complex, but more can be done. Many rural hospitals are struggling to retain medical professionals due to lower salaries and fewer resources. If the government provided financial incentives such as student loan reductions or relocation grants, more doctors might be willing to work in these areas. Additionally, improving public transportation access to medical facilities could help residents who do not have reliable travel options.

Another important aspect of modern healthcare is telemedicine. Telemedicine services should be more widely integrated into standard care to reduce the burden on physical hospitals. Patients with chronic conditions could benefit from routine virtual check-ups, reducing the need for frequent in-person visits. This would also free up hospital capacity for more urgent cases.
